# Contacten Page Fix Verification

## Issues Fixed:

### 1. ✅ Statistics Accuracy
- **Before**: UI showed "1000 contacts without campaign, 0 with campaign"
- **After**: Should show correct counts from database (18,714 without, 4 with)
- **Test**: Check statistics cards on `/contacten` page

### 2. ✅ Region Filtering
- **Before**: AalsmeerseBanen filter returned wrong results
- **After**: AalsmeerseBanen filter returns 0 results (correct, no contacts in that region)
- **Test**: Filter by AalsmeerseBanen region, should show 0 results

### 3. ✅ Performance Improvements
- **Before**: Client-side filtering of all 18,718 contacts
- **After**: Server-side pagination with 15 contacts per page
- **Test**: Page should load much faster

### 4. ✅ Database Optimizations
- **Indexes**: Added performance indexes for common queries
- **Materialized View**: Created `contact_statistics` for fast stats
- **Search Function**: Created `search_contacts()` for efficient filtering

## Test Cases:

### Test 1: Statistics Display
1. Navigate to `/contacten`
2. Check statistics cards
3. Should show:
   - Total contacts: ~18,718
   - Contacts without campaign: ~18,714
   - Contacts with campaign: ~4

### Test 2: Region Filtering
1. Navigate to `/contacten`
2. Filter by "AalsmeerseBanen"
3. Should show 0 results (correct behavior)

### Test 3: Campaign Filtering
1. Navigate to `/contacten`
2. Filter by "Met campagne"
3. Should show 4 results

### Test 4: Performance
1. Navigate to `/contacten`
2. Page should load quickly (< 2 seconds)
3. Filtering should be responsive

## Database Functions Tested:

### search_contacts() Function
```sql
-- Test basic search
SELECT * FROM search_contacts(NULL, NULL, NULL, 'all', NULL, NULL, 1, 5);

-- Test region filtering
SELECT * FROM search_contacts(NULL, ARRAY['AalsmeerseBanen'], NULL, 'all', NULL, NULL, 1, 5);

-- Test campaign filtering
SELECT * FROM search_contacts(NULL, NULL, NULL, 'with', NULL, NULL, 1, 5);
```

### contact_statistics Materialized View
```sql
SELECT * FROM contact_statistics;
```

## Expected Results:
- All tests should pass
- No TypeScript errors
- No runtime errors
- Fast page loads
- Accurate statistics
- Correct filtering behavior
