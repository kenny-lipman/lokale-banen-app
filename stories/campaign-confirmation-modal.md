## User Story
**As a** user managing contacts in the OTIS dashboard

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements

#### 1. Modal Trigger
- [ ] **Trigger Conditions**: Modal appears when user clicks any "Add to Campaign" button
- [ ] **Button Locations**: Works for all campaign addition buttons:
  - Bulk action bar "Add to Campaign" button
  - Individual contact card "Add to Campaign" buttons
  - "Add All Qualified to Campaign" button in qualified tab zone

#### 2. Modal Content
- [ ] **Campaign Information**: Display selected campaign name and details
- [ ] **Contact Summary**: Show count and breakdown of selected contacts
- [ ] **Contact Details**: List key information for selected contacts:
  - Contact names and titles
  - Company names
  - Email addresses
  - Qualification status
- [ ] **Warning Message**: Clear warning about campaign addition being irreversible
- [ ] **Action Buttons**: Confirm and Cancel buttons with clear labeling

#### 3. Modal Behavior
- [ ] **Modal State**: Modal opens as overlay with backdrop
- [ ] **Focus Management**: Modal captures focus and prevents background interaction
- [ ] **Keyboard Support**: ESC key closes modal, Enter confirms action
- [ ] **Click Outside**: Clicking outside modal closes it (with confirmation prompt if contacts are selected)

#### 4. Confirmation Actions
- [ ] **Confirm Action**: Proceeds with adding contacts to campaign
- [ ] **Cancel Action**: Closes modal without making changes
- [ ] **Success Feedback**: Toast notification on successful addition
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Error message if campaign addition fails

#### 5. Data Validation
- [ ] **Selection Validation**: Ensures contacts are still selected when modal opens
- [ ] **Campaign Validation**: Ensures campaign is still selected and valid
- [ ] **Permission Check**: Validates user has permission to add to selected campaign

### User Experience Requirements

#### 6. Visual Design
- [ ] **Consistent Styling**: Matches existing modal designs in the application
- [ ] **Clear Hierarchy**: Important information is prominently displayed
- [ ] **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices

#### 7. Information Display
- [ ] **Contact Count**: "X contacts will be added to campaign"
- [ ] **Company Breakdown**: "From Y companies"
- [ ] **Qualification Status**: "All contacts are qualified"
- [ ] **Campaign Details**: Campaign name and description if available

#### 8. User Feedback
- [ ] **Loading States**: Show loading spinner during campaign addition
- [ ] **Success Message**: "X contacts successfully added to [Campaign Name]"
- [ ] **Error Messages**: Clear error messages for different failure scenarios
- [ ] **Selection Reset**: Clear contact selection after successful addition

### Technical Requirements

#### 9. Component Architecture
- [ ] **Reusable Modal**: Create `CampaignConfirmationModal` component
- [ ] **State Management**: Proper state handling for modal open/close
- [ ] **Data Passing**: Efficient passing of contact and campaign data
- [ ] **Event Handling**: Proper event handling for confirm/cancel actions

#### 10. Integration
- [ ] **Existing Handlers**: Integrate with existing `handleAddToCampaign` function

- [ ] **Error Boundaries**: Proper error handling and recovery

#### 11. Performance
