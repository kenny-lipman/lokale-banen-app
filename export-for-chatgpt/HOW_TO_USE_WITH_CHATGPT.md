# How to Use This Export with ChatGPT

## Quick Start Options

### Option 1: Upload Key Files (Recommended)
Upload these files to ChatGPT in this order:
1. `EXPORT_README.md` - Project overview and architecture
2. `package.json` - Dependencies and scripts
3. `lib/supabase-service.ts` - Main database service layer
4. `app/api/contacts/route.ts` - Recent API we worked on
5. `app/contacten/page.tsx` - Contact management page

### Option 2: Copy-Paste Key Content
Copy and paste the content of `EXPORT_README.md` into your ChatGPT conversation, then attach specific files as needed.

## Sample ChatGPT Prompt
```
I'm working on a Next.js dashboard called Lokale-Banen. Here's my project export:

[Upload EXPORT_README.md]

This is a job scraping and email campaign management dashboard. I just fixed some Instantly API integration issues and want to continue developing features. The main tech stack is Next.js 14, TypeScript, Supabase, and Tailwind CSS.

Can you help me with [your specific question]?
```

## File Sizes
The export contains the most essential files (~50 files total) rather than the entire repository to stay within ChatGPT upload limits while providing maximum context.
