# Research Prompt: Data Relationship Interfaces for Bufferzone

## Research Objective

Design and validate the most intuitive and efficient user interface patterns for displaying hierarchical data relationships between companies and their associated contacts, specifically for a "Bufferzone" interface that combines scraping results with contact management in a unified workflow.

## Background Context

**Current State:**
- Separate "Current Run Results" card showing scraped companies/job postings
- Separate "All Scraped Contacts" card showing individual contacts
- No clear visual relationship between companies and their contacts
- User workflow requires mental mapping between different interface sections

**Target State:**
- Unified "Bufferzone" interface combining both datasets
- Clear visual hierarchy showing company → contact relationships
- Intuitive workflow: scrape companies → scrape contacts per company → assign contacts to campaigns
- Natural progression that users can understand without training

**User Journey:**
1. Start scrape → Companies and job postings scraped
2. Per company → Select to scrape contacts
3. View results → See contacts grouped by company
4. Campaign assignment → Select contacts per company for campaign entry

4. **What are the optimal information density and layout patterns for company-contact relationships?**
   - How much company information should be visible at the parent level?
   - What contact details are most important for quick scanning?
